## **Personal Commentary: Reflections on Course Structure** üìú

CSE 2050 is an essential part of the computer science curriculum, designed to push students to develop a deeper understanding of **data structures** and **algorithms**. As with any 2000-level university course, there is an expectation that students take ownership of their learning and invest additional time outside of lectures to fully grasp the material. The breadth of content covered in this course requires consistent practice and a proactive approach to learning.

---

### üéØ **Course Objectives**

1. Build proficiency in writing Python programs that utilize imports, functions, and object-oriented design.
2. Compare and analyze data structures and algorithms based on time and space complexity.
3. Implement various data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs) and abstract data types.
4. Solve problems using recursive algorithms and dynamic programming.

## üß† **Understanding Course Expectations**

In a 2000-level course like CSE 2050, the onus is on students to explore beyond what is covered in lectures. The **lectures and modules** introduce key concepts, but it‚Äôs crucial to dive deeper through self-study, homework, and lab assignments. While the course provides a solid framework, it requires students to engage with additional resources, collaborate with peers, and apply problem-solving strategies independently.

### üí° **Key Takeaways and Learning Strategies**

One of the challenges in a course of this scope is balancing theoretical understanding with practical implementation. The course covers a wide array of topics, including:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Strengthening basic programming skills to set a solid foundation for later, more complex topics.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing and comparing structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and graphs.
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Understanding time and space complexity to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms.

To succeed, I adopted several strategies:

1. **Regular Review**: Consistently reviewing lecture material and coding exercises to reinforce key concepts.
2. **Practice Projects**: Building small, practical projects outside of assignments to deepen my understanding of how data structures are used in real-world applications.
3. **Peer Collaboration**: Engaging in study groups to discuss and solve more challenging problems collaboratively.

## üó£ **Final Thoughts**

This course, like many 2000-level courses, requires a great deal of independent work. The content is broad, and while lectures provide a solid foundation, it‚Äôs up to the students to engage with the material on a deeper level. By actively working on labs, completing homework assignments, and applying the concepts to personal projects, I was able to bridge the gaps in understanding and gain a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
