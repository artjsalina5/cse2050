# CSE 2050: Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design - A Critical Reflection

## Course Overview
**Term:** Spring 2024  
**Instructor:** Chris Kmiecik ([chris.kmiecik@uconn.edu](mailto:chris.kmiecik@uconn.edu))  
**Textbook:** A First Course on Data Structures in Python (Open Source PDF)  
**Programming Language:** Python 3  

This repository reflects my personal journey and the challenges encountered while navigating the CSE 2050 course at the University of Connecticut. The course aims to introduce data structures and object-oriented design using Python but struggles with clarity and course structure.

## Objectives
- Develop an understanding of Python through hands-on practice with data structures and algorithms.
- Analyze the effectiveness of the teaching methods and course structure.

## Personal Commentary
### Reflections on Course Structure
The course attempts to cover an ambitious array of topics from basic programming to complex data structures. However, the approach to teaching Python basics is often unclear, which hinders the learning process, especially for students not already familiar with the language. The sequence of modules appears disjointed at times, contributing to a confusing learning experience.

### Exercises and Effectiveness
- **Python Fundamentals:** The course quickly glosses over fundamental Python concepts, which are crucial for the rest of the curriculum. This oversight leads to gaps in understanding that affect the performance in more complex topics.
- **Data Structures:** While the practical implementation of data structures is comprehensive, the rapid pace and lack of foundational Python training make these topics more challenging than they need to be.
- **Algorithm Complexity:** The discussions on algorithm complexity are often muddled by the insufficient grounding in basic programming principles, making these lectures less effective.

### Module Insights
The course's pacing and order of topics could be significantly improved. The transition between modules is often abrupt, with little time to adequately digest complex concepts before moving on. Additionally, the emphasis on theoretical aspects without sufficient practical examples leaves students unprepared for the assignments and exams.

## Challenges and Strategies for Improvement
The primary challenge has been to bridge the knowledge gap created by the course's ineffective teaching of Python basics. To overcome this, I have:
- Sought additional resources and tutorials to better understand Python.
- Engaged in study groups with peers to collaboratively tackle complex topics and share insights.
- Focused on practical application through personal projects like this repository to reinforce my learning.

## Course Evaluation
The course's ambitious scope is undermined by its poor execution. The teaching style, particularly in how Python is taught, needs a fundamental rethink. A more gradual introduction to Python, followed by a logical progression into data structures, could enhance understanding and retention.

## Concluding Thoughts
This course has been a challenging journey. Despite the course's shortcomings, it has provided a platform to delve into the intricacies of data structures and algorithms, albeit not as smoothly as I had hoped. Moving forward, I aim to continue refining my skills with additional self-study and project-based learning.
